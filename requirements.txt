# Note: Current Inquiry Methodology Framework focuses on transformative learning
# These dependencies support:
# - Question generation and analysis for educational contexts
# - Learning pathway design and personalization
# - Collaborative dialogue and perspective rotation analysis
# - Educational assessment and portfolio management
# - Transformative learning measurement and evaluation
# - Multi-modal learning content creation and management

# For basic Inquiry Framework functionality, core packages are sufficient
# Advanced educational features require domain-specific packages based on implementation:
# - K-12 Education: Focus on age-appropriate interfaces and gamification
# - Higher Education: Emphasis on research integration and academic rigor  
# - Corporate Training: Organizational learning and performance measurement
# - Personal Development: Self-reflection tools and goal tracking
# - Community Learning: Dialogue facilitation and consensus building

# Integration with Theoretical Ecosystem:
# - Works seamlessly with AADT for cognitive foundation
# - Complements CIOP for institutional implementation
# - Bridges theory and practice for real-world transformation
